# Amazon-Sales-Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI)
## Project Objective 
To create an annual sales report which analyze and optimize sales performance, profitability, and market reach by leveraging data on products, channels, geographies, and seasonal trends from 2010 to 2017

## Dataset used

## Data Visualization & Dashboard Creation (KPIs)
I created a Power BI report with the following:
Sales Performance Dashboard

A Bar Chart showing Sales by Product.
A Pie Chart displaying Sales by channel.
A Line Chart to visualize Sales Trend over Time (Year, Quarter, Month).
A Map showing Sales by Country.
A Table listing the Top 5 Products by Sales & Profit Margin.

## Interactivity & Insights
I added a slicer for filtering data by Year and Country.
Also added tooltips showing additional details when hovering over data points.
